Supervised learning model
dvJun13 is the dependent variable to be modelled for. It is binary in nature.
Expected output is an exported csv with probability score attached to each user_id, codes and performance measures for each model approach (AUC, KS, confusion matrix etc.)

Steps to execute:
1.Perform imputations for missing data as needed
2.Break the population into test(random 75%) and val(25%)
3.Check for correlations amongst variables
4.Run each of the below models and attach probaility score to a user_id for the val sample.
a.Logistic regression
b.Random Forest
c.XGBoost
d.SVM
e.Any other model approach
